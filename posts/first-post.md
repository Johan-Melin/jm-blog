## OVERVIEW

In this tutorial we will be using 3D and rigidbodies for collisions.

## Setting up the project

Start a new project in Unity with the 3D (URP) template.
For a start we'll only be using simple cubes to represent the player and enemies.
Start by rotating the camera downwards by setting it's X rotation to 90 and it's Y position to 30.
